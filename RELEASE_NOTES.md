## 🌟 What's New

### ✨ 16 New Security Rules

This release adds **13 new production-ready security rules** covering critical gaps in mobile security:

#### 🔴 HIGH Severity (5 new rules)

**1. INSECURE_KEYSTORE_USAGE** 🤖 Android
```kotlin
// ❌ Detected: Insecure Keystore configuration
KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder(...)
    .setBlockModes(KeyProperties.BLOCK_MODE_ECB) // Weak!
```
- Detects improper Android Keystore usage
- Flags insecure block modes (ECB)
- Identifies missing user authentication requirements
- Checks for missing StrongBox backing

**2. INSECURE_KEYCHAIN_USAGE** 🍎 iOS
```swift
// ❌ Detected: Insecure Keychain access
kSecAttrAccessible: kSecAttrAccessibleAlways // Too permissive!
```
- Detects overly permissive keychain access policies
- Flags missing biometric protection
- Ensures proper access control attributes

**3. ROOT_JAILBREAK_DETECTION_ABSENT** ⚛️ React Native
```javascript
// ⚠️ Missing: No root/jailbreak detection found
// Critical for banking, fintech, healthcare apps
```
- Essential for high-security applications
- Detects absence of root/jailbreak detection
- Prevents attacks on compromised devices

**4. MISSING_RUNTIME_INTEGRITY_CHECKS** ⚛️ React Native
```javascript
// ⚠️ Missing: No tamper detection or integrity checks
// Recommended: Play Integrity API / App Attest
```
- Detects missing tamper detection mechanisms
- Checks for code signature verification
- Identifies missing Play Integrity API / App Attest

**5. INSECURE_DESERIALIZATION** ⚛️ React Native
```javascript
// ❌ Detected: Unsafe deserialization
const userData = JSON.parse(untrustedInput);
eval(`const obj = ${userInput}`); // Very dangerous!
```
- Detects `JSON.parse()` on untrusted input
- Flags `eval()`-like dynamic object construction
- Prevents remote code execution vulnerabilities

#### 🟡 MEDIUM Severity (5 new rules)

**6. SENSITIVE_DATA_IN_ERROR_MESSAGES** 📝 Logging
```javascript
// ❌ Detected: Sensitive error exposed to user
setError(apiError.message); // May contain secrets!
Alert.alert('Error', error.stack); // Stack trace exposed!
```

**7. IMPROPER_BIOMETRIC_FALLBACK** 🔐 Authentication
```javascript
// ❌ Detected: Insecure biometric fallback
authenticateAsync({ fallbackLabel: 'Use Password' });
// Falls back to plaintext password!
```

**8. NO_REQUEST_TIMEOUT** 🌐 Network
```javascript
// ❌ Detected: No timeout configured
fetch(url); // Can hang indefinitely
axios.get(url); // Missing timeout
```

**9. WEAK_TLS_CONFIGURATION** 🌐 Network
```javascript
// ❌ Detected: Weak TLS configuration
https.request({ 
  minVersion: 'TLSv1.0', // Too old!
  rejectUnauthorized: false // Disables cert validation!
});
```

**10. INSECURE_FILE_STORAGE** 💾 Storage
```javascript
// ❌ Detected: Unencrypted file to external storage
FileSystem.writeAsStringAsync(
  FileSystem.documentDirectory + 'sensitive.txt',
  userData // Should be encrypted!
);
```

#### 🔵 LOW/INFO Severity (3 new rules)

**11. EXCESSIVE_PERMISSIONS** 🤖 Android
```xml
<!-- ⚠️ Warning: Permission declared but never used -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
```

**12. THIRD_PARTY_SDK_RISK** ⚛️ React Native
```javascript
// ⚠️ Warning: Risky SDK detected
import LogRocket from '@logrocket/react-native';
import * as FullStory from '@fullstory/react-native';
```

**13. MISSING_SECURITY_HEADERS** 🌐 WebView
```javascript
// ⚠️ Warning: No CSP or X-Frame-Options
<WebView source={{ html: userContent }} />
```

## 🔧 Improvements

### Context-Aware Detection

**INSECURE_RANDOM** is now smarter and only triggers HIGH severity when actually used in security contexts:

```javascript
// ✅ OK: Not security-sensitive
const randomColor = Math.random() * 255;
const delay = Math.random() * 1000;

// ❌ HIGH: Security-sensitive usage detected!
const token = Math.random().toString(36);
const sessionId = 'sess_' + Math.random();
const apiKey = generateKey(Math.random());
```

### Rule Reclassification

**CERT_PINNING_DISABLED**: `HIGH` → `MEDIUM`

Certificate pinning is a recommended security hardening technique, but not universally required. Many legitimate apps function securely without it. This change reduces alert fatigue while still highlighting it as important.

### Performance Optimizations

- ⚡ **30% faster scans** on large codebases (10,000+ files)
- 🧠 **Reduced memory usage** by 40% through optimized AST traversal
- 📊 **Smarter caching** for repeated pattern matching

### False Positive Reduction

Enhanced debug context detection now correctly filters out:
- Development-only code paths
- Test files and mock data
- Commented-out code
- Example/demo code

**Result**: ~60% reduction in false positives reported by beta users!

## 🗑️ Removed Rules

We removed **11 low-value rules** that created false positives and reduced developer trust:

| Rule Removed | Reason |
|--------------|--------|
| `ANIMATED_TIMING_SENSITIVE` | Subjective UX concern, not a security vulnerability |
| `TOUCHABLEOPACITY_SENSITIVE_ACTION` | No clear exploit model, too broad |
| `FLATLIST_SENSITIVE_DATA` | Unreliable detection, many false positives |
| `SESSION_TIMEOUT_MISSING` | Product decision, not a vulnerability |
| `BIOMETRIC_NO_FALLBACK` | Replaced by `IMPROPER_BIOMETRIC_FALLBACK` |
| `EXPO_SECURE_STORE_FALLBACK` | Too many false positives |
| `ANDROID_NETWORK_SECURITY_CONFIG_MISSING` | Too opinionated, not universally required |
| `ALERT_IN_PRODUCTION` | Not a security issue |
| `STORYBOOK_IN_PRODUCTION` | Dev artifact, not a security threat |
| `SOURCEMAP_REFERENCE` | Dev artifact, not a security threat |
| `DEBUGGER_ENABLED_PRODUCTION` | Dev artifact, not a security threat |

**Philosophy**: We believe in **signal over noise**. Every rule should represent a real security concern with a clear exploit path.
