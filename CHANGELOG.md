## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-18

### Major Feature Release

This release significantly expands rnsec's security coverage with **16 new high-impact rules**, improved context-aware detection, and better false positive filtering.

### Added

#### New HIGH Severity Rules

1. **INSECURE_KEYSTORE_USAGE** (Android)
   - Detects improper Android Keystore usage
   - Flags `BLOCK_MODE_ECB` (insecure block mode)
   - Identifies missing user authentication requirements
   - Checks for missing StrongBox backing

2. **INSECURE_KEYCHAIN_USAGE** (iOS)
   - Detects `kSecAttrAccessibleAlways` (insecure keychain access)
   - Flags missing `kSecAttrAccessControl` (no biometric protection)
   - Ensures keychain items require device authentication

3. **ROOT_JAILBREAK_DETECTION_ABSENT** (React Native)
   - Critical for banking, fintech, and healthcare apps
   - Detects missing root/jailbreak detection
   - Helps prevent attacks on compromised devices

4. **MISSING_RUNTIME_INTEGRITY_CHECKS** (React Native)
   - Detects missing tamper detection
   - Identifies missing code signature verification
   - Checks for missing Play Integrity API / App Attest usage

5. **INSECURE_DESERIALIZATION** (React Native)
   - Detects `JSON.parse()` on untrusted input
   - Flags `eval()`-like dynamic object construction
   - Identifies unsafe native deserialization

#### New MEDIUM Severity Rules

6. **SENSITIVE_DATA_IN_ERROR_MESSAGES** (Logging)
   - Detects backend errors exposed directly to UI
   - Flags production stack traces shown to users
   - Prevents information disclosure vulnerabilities

7. **IMPROPER_BIOMETRIC_FALLBACK** (Authentication)
   - Detects biometric auth with insecure fallbacks
   - Flags plaintext password fallbacks
   - Identifies PIN stored in JavaScript memory

8. **NO_REQUEST_TIMEOUT** (Network)
   - Detects network requests without timeout configuration
   - Prevents denial-of-service (DoS) risks
   - Ensures proper timeout handling for fetch/axios/xhr

9. **WEAK_TLS_CONFIGURATION** (Network)
   - Detects TLS < 1.2 usage
   - Flags custom `httpsAgent` with insecure options
   - Identifies disabled certificate validation

10. **INSECURE_FILE_STORAGE** (Storage)
    - Detects files written to external/shared storage
    - Flags unencrypted file writes
    - Checks for proper file encryption on sensitive data

#### New LOW/INFO Severity Rules

11. **EXCESSIVE_PERMISSIONS** (Android)
    - Detects Android permissions declared but unused in code
    - Helps minimize attack surface
    - Improves privacy compliance

12. **THIRD_PARTY_SDK_RISK** (React Native)
    - Flags known risky SDKs (session replay, invasive analytics)
    - Identifies ad SDKs in sensitive apps (banking, healthcare)
    - Helps maintain user privacy

13. **MISSING_SECURITY_HEADERS** (WebView)
    - Detects missing Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
    - Flags missing X-Frame-Options
    - Improves web content security

### Improved

- **Context-Aware Detection**: `INSECURE_RANDOM` now only triggers HIGH severity when actually used in security-sensitive contexts (token/key generation)
- **Rule Reclassification**: `CERT_PINNING_DISABLED` moved from HIGH → MEDIUM severity (reflects real-world usage patterns)
- **False Positive Reduction**: Enhanced debug context filtering to eliminate noise
- **Performance**: Optimized rule engine for faster scans on large codebases

### Removed

Eliminated low-value rules that created false positives and reduced developer trust:

- `ANIMATED_TIMING_SENSITIVE` (subjective UX concern, not security)
- `TOUCHABLEOPACITY_SENSITIVE_ACTION` (no clear exploit model)
- `FLATLIST_SENSITIVE_DATA` (too broad, unreliable detection)
- `SESSION_TIMEOUT_MISSING` (product decision, not vulnerability)
- `BIOMETRIC_NO_FALLBACK` (replaced by `IMPROPER_BIOMETRIC_FALLBACK`)
- `EXPO_SECURE_STORE_FALLBACK` (false positives)
- `ANDROID_NETWORK_SECURITY_CONFIG_MISSING` (too opinionated)
- `ALERT_IN_PRODUCTION` (not a security issue)
- `STORYBOOK_IN_PRODUCTION` (dev artifact, not security threat)
- `SOURCEMAP_REFERENCE` (dev artifact, not security threat)
- `DEBUGGER_ENABLED_PRODUCTION` (dev artifact, not security threat)

### Statistics

- **Total Rules**: 63 → 66 security rules
- **Coverage**: Android, iOS, React Native, Network, Storage, Auth, Crypto, Logging, WebView
- **Detection Patterns**: 27+ API key patterns, 15+ crypto patterns, 20+ network patterns
- **Scan Speed**: < 100ms for most projects

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed TypeScript errors in `webviewScanner.ts` with null safety checks
- Fixed `authenticationScanner.ts` missing rule exports
- Improved HTML report rendering for edge cases
- Fixed line number display in code snippets

### Security

- All new rules thoroughly tested for false positives
- Enhanced AST-based detection for accuracy
- Improved pattern matching for secrets detection
